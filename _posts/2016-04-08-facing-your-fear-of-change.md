_The
greatest mistake you can make in life is be continually fearing you will make
one. - Elbert Hubbard _

Let's be honest. Change freaks us out. I think, more so than anything else. We try not to think about it because its inevitable and affects us in so many ways. All of us have a certain degree of fear when it comes to the unknown because it forces us out of our comfort zone.

The thing is we all need to navigate the twists and turns of life and unfortunately that does require change of some kind. This can be a change in where we live, new relationships, changes in behavior, changes in attitudes, careers, etc. Any of these can bring on some level of stress. How often have we dreaded the uncertainty of what was ahead of us? Did you go ahead and face the challenge only to realize that the fear was worse than the actual outcome? Or did you turn back because you did not want to face the possibility of failure? Regardless of the level of fear that you are dealing with you can stare it in the face and overcome it.

The one thing that stands in our way when it comes to change is FEAR. It is the uncertainty of the future. Do you realize that we only feel fear when it comes to the future and not the past?

We've all done it. We fixate on all of the possible outcomes of a situation, the worst case scenarios. All of these scenarios are what is causing us worry, anxiety and fear. It takes us away from being in the present and what is currently happening. In all reality, we are creating living nightmares for ourselves by doing this.

Why don't you try being curious rather than being afraid?

Be curious, even optimistic about the change that is going to take place. What would it mean for you if this happened? Try to focus on the facts, instead of the nightmares that are living inside your head.

One way to really overcome fear is to get familiar with it and even to embrace it. I know this sounds crazy but the whole reason we get scared is because we feel like we are no longer in control of our lives. But, in reality, we really never are. So, when we are faced with change, we are then reminded that we are never fully in control. Instead of avoiding change, it is important to accept the fact that we are not in control of the external forces in our lives and to embrace the things that we can control --- our attitude and emotions.

Another thing you can do to conquer your fear is to have faith, in yourself or something bigger than yourself. I'm not talking about blind faith but a faith that makes you fully accountable and active in the change that is taking part in your life. **_The important thing to remember is to not let other people influence how you feel about your change. Don't let them create a doubt in you that will set you back in the wrong direction. _**There is nothing more powerful in life than what you choose to believe. Therefore, keep your faith and tell them to keep their doubts.

It is important to know that change is actually an open door, full of possibilities. With this being said, you cannot fully grasp that until you have stared the fear of change in the face and face it. You have to be resilient and ultimately faith in yourself. I always tell myself to look back at what has happened in my life and how change has impacted me.

Where would I be if I did not accept those changing factors?

When asking myself this question, I look back at a time when I stared change in the face. The decision that I made to leave something behind that I'd come to know well for the uncertainty of things to come scared the living crap out of me. I was afraid of the unknown, I was afraid of losing an experience I loved and fought so hard for but most importantly, If I stayed, I was afraid of losing myself. So, I stepped out of the world that I had known and started over. I had those who helped me along the way but I was still scared. I had been filled with doubts from some people who were trying to protect me but I stuck with it and I made it through. I don't think that I would be the same person that I am today if I did not make that choice to face my fears head on.

I didn't really believe in myself at the time but I did believe in something bigger than me; a higher power. I believed that these were the doors that he was opening for me and that I could be scared but moving forward into uncertainty, and into the change was the right thing to do. You see, I was curious on how my life was going to turn out because if I had stayed, I already knew what the outcome would be. Attaining the life I wanted required me to forgo the comfort I'd known and it was something that I was willing to take the risk for. At that time and in that moment of decision, I realized that I had the power to face this fear and move forward with my life.

Nothing could take that power from me any longer. Now when I look back, I see a person who faced his greatest fear and the outcome wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Times were tough for a little bit but I worked through them.

So, you see, when you face your fears and accept change as being a part of life, great things can happen to you. You need to have faith, and you must be fearless if not in your heart, fearless in your actions.
