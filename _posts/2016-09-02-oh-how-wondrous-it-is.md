  Oh how wondrous it is to be born a thinking feeling thing in world filled with
  sharp edges. To be born immobile, crawl, walk, and eventually run. To be
  ignorant and through experience become educated, and through half measures
  become learned and through practice gain outward acceptance. To be told to
  slow down for you move to fast. To be told to stand idle for it is not the
  time to walk. To be told you might best learn by crawling. And finally to be
  forced into immobility.

# Oh, how wondrous it is...

Oh how wondrous it is to be born a thinking feeling thing in world filled with sharp edges. To be born immobile, crawl, walk, and eventually run. To be ignorant and through experience become educated, and through half measures become learned and through practice gain outward acceptance. To be told to slow down for you move to fast. To be told to stand idle for it is not the time to walk. To be told you might best learn by crawling. And finally to be forced into immobility. 

Wither. 

If you allow it, you might be led to believe that it is by thickening your hide, accepting the negativity that exists around you, and becoming idle is how you shelter yourself from a world filled with sharpened edges.   
It is not, it is in giving yourself freely to those you call FRIEND. Being a shield to guard against the sharpest edges, and a reaffirming voice of hope when all faith is lost. To propel the immobile, to shoulder the unsteady, to encourage the fearful, and champion the willing. Oh how wondrous it is to be born a thinking feeling thing in a world filled with sharp edges and to have so many to call. 

friend.
